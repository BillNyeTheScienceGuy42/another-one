  GitHub Pages rewrite for React Router SPA
  Redirect all requests to index.html

/* match all files, send to index.html */
/* this is required for client-side routing to work */

/*
  This file should be placed in the public/ directory of your Vite project.
  When you deploy, it will be copied to the root of your GitHub Pages site.
*/

/* redirect all requests to index.html */
/* this is the only line that matters for Vite + React Router */
/* see: https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages */

/*
  The following line is the actual redirect rule:
*/

/* /!* /index.html 200 */

/*
  But Vite and GitHub Pages do not support _redirects natively.
  Instead, you need to use a 404.html fallback.
